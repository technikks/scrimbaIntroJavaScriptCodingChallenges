        <strong>Challenge #12: Switch Statements</strong><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Our business wants to convince users to upgrade their accounts.</li><br>
            <li>ICheck a user's account type (switch) of 'shopper', 'super shopper', & 'guest'.</li><br>
            <li>If a user is a 'guest' ask them if they want to upgrade to a 'shopper'.</li><br>
            <li>If a user is a 'shopper' ask if they want to upgrade to a 'super shopper'</li><br>
            <li>If a user is a 'super shopper' tell them they are the best!</li><br>
            <li>If we don't know user's status they are a guest.</li>
        </ol><br>
        Open up the console to see!

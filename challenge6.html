        <strong>Challenge #6: Arrays</strong><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Your company is launching 3 new products: toilet paper, bottled water, and sanitizer. Store them in a list.</li><br>
            <li>Turns out there was a mistake and toilet paper was actually paper towels. Make the appropriate update.</li><br>
            <li>Sanitizer sells out. Remove it from the list.</li><br>
            <li>Business is so good the company launches a new product: Bleach. Add it to the list.</li>
        </ol><br>
        After creating the initial array do not just create a brand new array. Modify it accordingly. 
        <br>
        Open up the console to see!

        // Removing sanitizer from the list. 
        products.pop()
        console.log(products); 

        // Adding bleach to the end of the array. 
        products.push(`bleach`)

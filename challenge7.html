        <strong>Challenge #7: Objects</strong><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Your organization needs the user's personal information to ship the inventory to. Create an object to store the data in.</li><br>
            <li>Store a user's first and last name.</li><br>
            <li>Store a user's address. City and state will be enough. Have this as a nested object. (Interface Segregation Principle)</li><br>
            <li>The business wants to give more personalized ads and wants to collect information about the user's hobbies. Create a list of hobbies.</li><br>
            <li>Are they a gold member? Store a boolean with this value.</li>
        </ol><br>
        Open up the console to see!
